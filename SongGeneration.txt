1. Set BPM - determines how fast song will be

2. Set length of song

3. Choose Key
	- look in ScaleMutator Panel, check how keys are saved, probably in arrays

4. Choose Scale
	- look in ScaleMutator Panel, check how scales are saved, probably in arrays

5. Difficulty:
	- Easy - only whole and half notes
	- Medium - "" + quarter notes
	- Hard - "" + sixteenth notes
 	- Insane - "" + thirty-second notes
	* all note lengths saved in array; location in array as a power of 2 = note length

6. Number of instruments:							MIDI value:
	- 1 player: Piano								- 1
	- 2 player: Previous + Electric Guitar (Clean)					- 28
	- 3 player: Previous + Drums							- 36
	- 4 player: Previous + Bass							- 35
	- 5 player: Previous + Electric Guitar (Distorted)				- 31
	- 6 player: Previous + Cowbell (Secret mode easter egg xD)			- 56

Additional 6th option:
	Randomness:
	- have preset rhythyms that are randomly chosen; as randomness increases, more individual notes are picked 	  instead of having different preset rhythyms picked

Drums Idea:
	- Left 4 fingers are constant beat (constant), right 4 are filler notes (unique, different)

THEN:
Random number chooses whether or not an individual note from the scale is played or a preset rhythym is played and another random number chooses how long the note will be played for
