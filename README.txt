	A multiplayer keyboard rhythym game developed in Java for Computer Systems
	Mentorship, 2017-18.

RUNNING THE GAME:

	Run "Alpha Band.bat" to launch game, or run cg_Client (in the src/main/java folder)
	through your favorite IDE. Use the game menu to navigate.

HOW TO PLAY:

	Once you have joined a server, you will have to vote on your song choice. Select
	which option you want, then press SUMBIT. There are options for a randomly chosen
	song or to have a computer-generated song.

	When the countdown ends, the game will start. As notes come down the screen, try
	to play their corresponding key as close to the key squares as possible. The clower
	you are, the more points you will earn.

STARTING A SERVER:

	In the SERVER menu, select CREATE. Then, fill out your server's name, game mode, and
	difficulty. Press LAUNCH and you should have a server!

CREATING A SONG:

	In the STUDIO menu, you will find a song creation system for the game. Here, you can
	write or transcribe songs into the game's format, so you can play the song in-game.
	Place notes with the left mouse button and delete notes with the right. Remember to
	save your work often!

	You will only be able to play songs in your src/main/resources/songs folder if you
	are running the server. However, you can play or share game songs by copying or
	downloading a song .cfg file.

MORE INFO:

	If you are interested in the plethora of workings behind the game, paticularly the
	networking, check out the EngineFlowchart.xml in the Alpha-Band folder. Open it
	with some online .xml file viewer, and take a look at how this game is running over
	a network.

ACKNOWLEDGEMETS:

	A special thanks to the Reverend Doctor Oberle, our teacher. Without him, I would be
	completely lost, not only on this project but in general direction. Dr. Oberle has
	helped me discover my passion and learn about myself. He has taught me in and out of
	the bounds of school. Several years and many hundereds of hours have been spent by
	Dr. Oberle to mentor me to this point. There are few teachers who have the same
	dedication, inspiration, and humor as he. Thanks for dealing with me for all these
	years :)
